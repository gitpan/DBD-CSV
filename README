Module
    DBD::CSV - DBI driver for CSV files

Description
    The DBD::CSV module is yet another driver for the DBI (Database
    independent interface for Perl). This one is based on the SQL
    "engine" SQL::Statement and the abstract DBI driver DBD::File
    and implements access to so-called CSV files (Comma separated
    values).

Warning
    THIS IS ALPHA SOFTWARE. It is *only* 'Alpha' because the
    interface (API) is not finalized. The Alpha status does not
    reflect code quality or stability.
